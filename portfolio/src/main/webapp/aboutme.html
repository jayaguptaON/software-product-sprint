                Hi! My name is Jaya. I'm a nanotechnology engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I'm interested in software development and enjoy learning to code. Below is some more info about me. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p><span>I</span>'m studying nanotechnology engineering, which involves the manipulation of matter at the atomistic level to create innovations in various fields, including pharmaceuticals, electronics, and new materials, among others. I chose this field because it's multidisciplinary; it combines multiple areas I'm interested in, including electrical engineering, chemical engineering, materials science, and biology. You can read more about the program <a class="link" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/nanotechnology/about-nanotechnology-engineering">here</a></p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <h3><i class="material-icons-round">code</i>&nbsp;Coding</h3>
        <p><span>I</span>'m very interested in learning how to code because I like building things and problem solving. Currently, I can code in Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and MATLAB. I have learnt these languages both through school and on my own through hackathons and online resources. I'm currently working on further developing my skills in web development and machine learning/AI. I would also love to learn back-end programming in the future. Check out my <a href="impossiblelist.html#skillsgoals" class="link">impossible list</a>.</p>

        <h3><i class="material-icons-round">create</i>&nbsp;Design</h3>
        <p><span>I</span> like learning about UX/UI design and HCI (human-computer interactions). I'm proficient in design tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and UXPin.</p>

        <h3><i class="material-icons-round">code</i>&nbsp;Hackathons</h3>
        <p><span>I</span> enjoy attending hackathons because it gives me the opportunity to try solving real problems with tech. I get to develop my skills while meeting other students. My first hackathon was ECOding Hacks hosted by TOHacks at York University, where my team (pictured below) created a web-app called <a href="projects.html#envirokids" class="link">EnviroKids</a> to educate kids about the environment. EnviroKids won the top prize in its category.</p> 
        <img class="hackathonimages" src="images/ecodinghacks.jpg" alt="ECOding Hacks Team" width="400" height="267">
        <p>Next, I attended WiC Hacks 2019 at the Rochester Institute of Technology. My team created <a href="projects.html#meelia" class="link">MeeLia</a>, a mental health voice assistant. MeeLia won the MLH Best Hardware Award. Most recently, I attended TechTogether 2019 in Boston. There, my team (pictured below) competed in the IBM challenge with an AI program called <a href="projects.html#smarthire" class="link">SmartHire</a> whose goal was to help eliminate AI bias in the hiring process. Our project won the IBM Research Award and the Liberty Mutual Best Hack for Gender Equality Award.</p>

        <h3><i class="material-icons-round">group</i>&nbsp;BioTEC Conference</h3>
        <p><span>I</span> help organize the University of Waterloo BioTEC Conference, an annual student-run biotechnology and bioengineering conference that strives to promote some of the most cutting edge developments at the intersection of biology and engineering. You can find more info about BioTEC <a href="https://www.uwbiotec.ca/" class="link" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h3><i class="material-icons-round">pool</i>&nbsp;Swimming</h3>
        <p><span>I</span>'m an avid swimmer and was on my high school's competitive swim team. I've also done lifeguard training through the National Lifesaving Society.</p>

        <h3><i class="material-icons-round">flight</i>&nbsp;Traveling</h3>
        <p><span>I</span> enjoy traveling to new places. Most recently, I visited New York City, but I've also been to Quebec City, Ottawa, Orlando, Boston, Washington, DC, and India. There are lots of other places I'd like to visit - check out my <a href="impossiblelist.html#travelgoals" class="link">impossible list</a> for more.</p>
        <p>My favourite trip so far has been to Quebec City where I had the opportunity to join the World Vision delegation of 75 students from across Canada to the G7 Summit in June 2018 and participate in a demonstration (pictured below) to advocate for girls' education. Us 75 students represented the 75 million children out-of-school around the world due to crisis. Our demonstration was a success, as the G7 countries later announced they would pledge $3.8 billion for girls' education, $400 million of which were pledged by Canada.
